Deployment of trading app

# Introduction  
Every application must be deployed in order to make it accessible to users. To understand how to deploy an application, trading app is deployed. This documentation will give a clear view of how this deployment is done.  

Describe your project at a high level (microserver, psql, java)

 Two docker files  
  - trading-app  
   - talk about the process (e.g. compile and package jar and run the app)  
  - jrvs-psql  
   - talk about how to create tables (e.g. schema.sql)
